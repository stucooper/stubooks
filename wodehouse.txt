# This file is a bit different for two reasons
# (1) I would like to collect all of Wodehouse so I'm enumerating his works
# (2) His books often published under different US titles
#     so they are mentioned also eg
# The Cat Nappers (US) == Aunt's Aren't Gentlemen (UK)
# UK titles are preferred throughout. Earliest published date preferred.
# See Frances Donaldson pp 355-359
